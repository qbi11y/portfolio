        "longStatement": "I have a passion for solving problems large and small. When I can leverage design and technology to solve problems I thrive. Using the design process, I can understand the problem space and the user and generate potential solutions. The technology aspect allows me to communicate those solutions in coded prototypes that can be shared with stakeholders and users for rapid feedback and iterations.\n\nMy workplace experiences and the foundation I acquired while earning my degrees in Architecture and Graphic Design from the College of Design at North Carolina State University, has enabled me to be a more versatile designer and dedicated team member. I am committed to learning and expanding my skill set.\n\nI prefer engaging with users and looking broadly across the organization to identify opportunities to add value to both the organization and the user. I seek to understand the users’ context and needs, and the needs of the business as they are the key to any successful design.\n\nLet’s see how we can work together to solve your problem!",
