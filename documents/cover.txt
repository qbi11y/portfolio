To whom it may concern

My name is James and I'm excited to help Indeed empower their customers through compelling user experiences using my coding skills and my experience as a Design Technologist. I've worked for IBM since my previous employer was acquired in 2016. As a User Experience Designer, moving into a Design Technologist role, I have led a multi-disciplinary team through the design process to deliver a Cloud Brokerage Platform that allowed customers to proactively track their cloud spending, which resulted in lowering operational costs. 

In my current role as Design Technologist, I am contributing reusable components to the IBM Cloud Cognitive pattern library and leading the design effort on an IBM Research Edge Network project that seeks to manage datasets globally. 

Indeed is one of, if not, the top destination for job seekers. As I am currently leveraging Indeed to identify opportunities my eye as a designer has me thinking about ideas that could enhance the already fantastic experience. 

I know that Indeed is a design driven organization and that tells me that they put their users first. As someone who thrives in a user focused environment, I truly feel that my skills and experience would be a great match at Indeed.

Thank you for your time. I know that I can bring a level of expertise and open mindedness to ensure that Indeed continues to excel and impact their users through thoughtful user experiences. I'd love to discuss how my skills and experience can help you in achieving your goals.

Kind Regards,
